  <h3 class="w3-center">ABOUT THE VESSEL</h3>
  <p><strong>Peregrine</strong> is a Bruce Roberts Voyager 495 — a 50-foot steel expedition-style sailing vessel built for high-latitude cruising and ocean exploration. With an enormous interior layout featuring multiple cabins, she's the perfect choice for families, guests, or those simply seeking space and comfort. The aft cabin boasts a king-sized berth and even a full-sized bathtub in the head.</p>
  <p>The deck salon / pilothouse design creates a bright, spacious interior with excellent visibility, while her robust construction delivers exceptional comfort and stability offshore — the most comfortable vessel I've sailed offshore by far. She has served as a wonderful floating home for our family of four over the past few years, but as our plans evolve, we hope to find a new owner who can fully utilize her capabilities.</p>
  <p>Peregrine was professionally built by Intertech Marine in Halifax, Canada, in 2001. The shipyard constructed and outfitted the vessel entirely — this is not an amateur-built boat. Outfitted with top-tier equipment including Selden spars, Furlex furlers, Anderson self-tailing winches, and Harken batcars, no expense was spared during construction.</p>
  <p>We purchased Peregrine in 2019. At that time, she had been out of use for some years and required attention. We committed to a multi-year, extensive refit to restore and modernize her systems. Since then, she has proven herself as a sturdy, reliable, and comfortable long-range cruiser. Peregrine has taken us up and down the U.S. East Coast and has truly become a fantastic base for sailing and living.</p>
